## Prerequisites Checklist
- [ ] MetaMask installed and set up
- [ ] Polygon Amoy testnet added to MetaMask
- [ ] Test MATIC tokens in your wallet
- [ ] PolygonScan API key

## Step 1: Add Polygon Amoy to MetaMask

If you haven't added Polygon Amoy testnet yet:

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click network dropdown ‚Üí "Add Network"
3. Add these details:
   - **Network Name**: Polygon Amoy Testnet
   - **RPC URL**: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology
   - **Chain ID**: 80002
   - **Currency Symbol**: MATIC
   - **Block Explorer**: https://amoy.polygonscan.com

## Step 2: Get Test MATIC

1. Visit: https://faucet.polygon.technology/
2. Connect your MetaMask wallet
3. Select "Polygon Amoy" network
4. Request test MATIC (you need ~0.1 MATIC for deployment)

## Step 3: Get PolygonScan API Key

1. Go to: https://polygonscan.com/apis
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Create a new API key
4. Copy the API key

## Step 4: Get Your Private Key

‚ö†Ô∏è **SECURITY WARNING**: Never share your private key!

1. Open MetaMask
2. Click your account icon ‚Üí Account details
3. Click "Export Private Key"
4. Enter your MetaMask password
5. Copy the private key (starts with 0x)

## Step 5: Configure Environment

1. Open `contracts/.env` file
2. Replace `your_private_key_here` with your actual private key
3. Replace `your_polygonscan_api_key_here` with your API key

## Step 6: Deploy Contract

Open terminal and run:

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npm run deploy:amoy
```

You should see output like:
```
Deploying ClothingNFT contract to Polygon Amoy...
ClothingNFT deployed to: 0x1234567890abcdef...
Contract verified successfully
```

## Step 7: Update Main App

1. Copy the contract address from the deployment output
2. Open your main project's `.env` file
3. Update this line:
   ```
   VITE_NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x_your_actual_contract_address_here
   ```

## Step 8: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ‚úÖ Success Indicators

After successful deployment:
- "Contract Setup Required" warnings disappear
- Admin panel shows NFT upload functionality
- Users can claim NFTs after purchase
- Contract appears on https://amoy.polygonscan.com

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds for gas"
- Get more test MATIC from the faucet
- Wait a few minutes and try again

### "Network error"
- Check MetaMask is connected to Polygon Amoy
- Verify RPC URL is correct

### "Invalid private key"
- Ensure private key starts with 0x
- Check for extra spaces or characters

### "API key error"
- Verify PolygonScan API key is correct
- Try creating a new API key

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the terminal output for specific error messages
2. Verify all prerequisites are met
3. Try the deployment again after fixing any issues

The deployment typically takes 2-3 minutes and costs less than $0.10 in test MATIC.
